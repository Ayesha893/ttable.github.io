All educational institutes are offering a number of different disciplines these days and each
discipline has a number of subjects. There are limited faculty members in all educational institutes
therefore each faculty member has to teach more than one subjects. Also, there are limited rooms
for classes and lab activities for different batches. We have to schedule a timetable for effective
resource utilization. This timetable should ensure that there is neither an overlapping of faculty
member nor class room. Timetable scheduling is a very hectic job which takes a lot of time and
effort. Any updation or correction may make this task cumbersome if done manually. There is a
need to automate this task with the help of an online system which generates a timetable. This
Timetable management system will be a web-based application which can schedule timetable
according to classes, subjects and faculty members.
